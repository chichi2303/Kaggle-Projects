 The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. This project will use the report that was published in 2015. The World Happiness 2015, which ranks 158 countries by their happiness level, was released at the United Nation at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organization, and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
